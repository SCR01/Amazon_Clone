# Amazon Clone

This is a simple Amazon clone project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project simulates an Amazon-like user interface with various pages for product browsing, user login/signup, and a shopping cart. This is a front-end-only project and serves as a practice for creating static web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Once deployed or running locally, you can navigate through the pages by visiting each HTML file:

- **Home Page:** `index.html` (or `/src/index.html` depending on setup)
- **Login Page:** `login.html`
- **Signup Page:** `signup.html`
- **Product Page:** `product.html`
- **Cart Page:** `cart.html`

Each page represents a simple, static version of an Amazon-like interface, but actions like login, signup, and adding items to the cart are not functional as this is a front-end-only project.
